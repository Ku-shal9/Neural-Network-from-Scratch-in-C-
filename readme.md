# MNIST Digit Recognizer (Minimal Neural Network)

Small C++ project that trains and evaluates a simple feed‑forward neural network on MNIST-like PNG images. The code uses Eigen for linear algebra, OpenCV for image I/O, and SQLite for a simple console login check.

---

## Features

- Two-layer neural network (one hidden layer + output layer)
- Custom activation functions and training loop (forward / backward)
- Loads PNG images with OpenCV and converts to normalized Eigen vectors
- Simple console login backed by SQLite (`users.db`)
- Train and test routines with accuracy reporting

---

## Requirements (macOS)

- C++17 capable compiler (g++ / clang++)
- Homebrew (recommended) to install deps:
  - Eigen3
  - OpenCV 4
  - sqlite3
  - openssl (used by linker flags in Makefile)
  - pkg-config

Install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install eigen opencv sqlite openssl pkg-config
```
